# interview-junior-backend-python

Dear Applicant,

Thank you once again for apply for the Junior Backend Developer position at it-excelsus GmbH. With the following task, we would like to assess your coding skills. The expected timeline for this assigment is **one week**.

Below, you will find two folders. The [`backend`](./backend) contains a FastAPI application. The [`data`](./data) folder provides an example of what a database could look like when it contains data.

# What is the task?

The main task is to build a system where we can call an API with parameters and can expect an image from it.

1. Simulation API:
    - Build an API for running simulations, (physics, biology, finance, blockchain). User can input parameters for various systems, and the API sh


You can choose of **one** of the following "flavors":

1. Physics Simulation API:
    - Build an API for running physics simulations. User can input parameters for various physical systems, and the API should return simulated results. Use FastAPI to handle simulation requests and provide detailed output data.
2. Biological Sequence Analysis API:
    - Create an API for analyzing biological sequences (e.g. DNA, RNA, protein). Implement functionalities such as sequence alignment, motif searching and structure predictions. Utilize FastAPI for efficent processing of sequence data.
3. Scientific Data Visualization API:
    - Create an API using FastAPI that allows users to upload scientific data files (e.g. CSV, HDF5)




1. **Backend:** Create 


# How to install the enviroment and Run the Application

1. Install Anaconda/Miniconda on your system
2. Create the Enviroment given with ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
3. Execute ````start_server.sh``
